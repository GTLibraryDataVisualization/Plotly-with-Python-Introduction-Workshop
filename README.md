# Plotly-with-Python-Introductory-Workshop
Using Plotly API for python in order to create a 3D scatter plot
Here I will explain the contents of this workbook, and how to run each file
The preferred and easiest way to run the file is using plotly_workshop.py
Here are the steps to do so
1.  Make sure you have python 3.X installed onto your machine and it can be run through the command line
2. Download the materials and save them in a folder on your desktop called plotly_workshop
3. Make sure you have pandas, numpy, and plotly installed.  This can be done with the commands: 

        pip install pandas
        pip install numpy
        pip install plotly  
        pip install chart_studio

        
From there you should be almost ready to run your script.

4. Create a plotly account and retrieve your username and API key from settings.

5. Edit plotly_workshop and replace the sample username and API key with your own.

6. To run, open command line and run the commands given in the commands.txt file.

7. Enjoy your visualization.

To use with jupyter notebook (Plotly_workshop_new.ipynb) - Note this is more complicated, and some prior CS experience is reccomended
the Jupyter notebook file contains my explanations as well as the code itself

1.  Make sure you have python 3.X installed onto your machine and it can be run through the command line
2. Download the materials and save them in a folder on your desktop called plotly_workshop
3. Make sure you install jupyter notebook for python 3.  This is most commonly done by installing the latest distribution of annaconda. (this can be easily googled)
4. make sure you have pandas, numpy, and plotly installed, using annaconda.  This can be done with the command: 

                conda install pandas
                conda install numpy
                conda install plotly 
                conda install chart_studio

From there you should be almost ready to run your script.

5. Create a plotly account and retrieve your username and API key from settings. 

6. navagate to the folder using the first command in commands.txt 

7. type "jupyter notebook" into the commandline 

8. This should open a web browser, with a file navagator

9. Open the file 

10. Edit and replace the sample username and API key with your own

11. you should now be able to run the jupyter notebook successfully

    "\n",
    "    Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and reads closer to English than other languages. Identation is VERY important. It is necessary for Python to know \"what comes after what.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Basic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "    During this lessson plan we will be using a few different types--\n",
    "        String: a sequence of letters and symbols surrounded by \"\"\n",
    "        Integer: whole number (ex: 5)\n",
    "        float: number with decimal places (ex: 5.3)\n",
    "        Object: a special type that has its own methods we can use.\n",
    "        A method is a series of lines of code that accomplishes some task.\n",
    "        Dataframe: special object imported by the pandas library, allows us\n",
    "        to create a relational way of viewing and manipulating data.\n",
    "        Series/List: simply a list of some form of data.\n",
    "        Dictionary: a series of mappings from one type to another.\n",
    "        \n",
    "What does \"Import\" do?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The import statement gives us functions, objects or a set of objects and functions (known as a\n",
    "    library) that other people created that we would like to use. It saves us from having to write a\n",
    "    bunch of code ourselves. The 'as' keyword lets us address this library as any nickname we give it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    numpy\n",
    "            Gives us the ability to create a series object, series objects are \n",

    "            This gives us easy access to plotly's plotting methods.\n",
